            title: "Accessibility"
            description: "Many people do not have Facebook or Meetup accounts. Facebook's popularity has sharply declined with younger generations and Meetup is less popular with elders. Registering directly on Sahaj Atlas is easier and doesn't require an account - making it more likely for seekers to register."

            description: "When seekers register on Sahaj Atlas we can store their email address (without the restrictions of Meetup, Eventbrite, or Facebook). This means we can use these email addresses to send follow-up materials, or recommend special Sahaj events in their area (eg. concerts or intermediate programs)."
