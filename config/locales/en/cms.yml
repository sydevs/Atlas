          problem: "We don't want seekers to see classes which are no longer running. Many Sahaj website have out of date program information, but even when the details are updated they quickly become outdated again."
          solution: "To solve this, we've created an automatic system that will email the yogis who run each program every few months to ask if the information is still correct. If they do not respond, the program will be hidden from the public until it is checked."
          review: "As soon as an event becomes classified as \"Needs Review\" the program manager will be sent an email asking them to confirm that the event details are still correct. If they do not respond within 1 week, the city manager will be sent an email asking them to check the details instead."
          expiration: "If %{duration} pass without the event being verified, then it's hidden from the map until someone checks and updates it."

            title: "Accessibility"
            description: "Many people do not have Facebook or Meetup accounts. Facebook's popularity has sharply declined with younger generations and Meetup is less popular with elders. Registering directly on Sahaj Atlas is easier and doesn't require an account - making it more likely for seekers to register."
