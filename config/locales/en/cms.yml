        description:
          introduction: "The Sahaj Atlas supports having seekers register on Meetup, Eventbrite, Facebook or other services in order to make it easier for local yogis to make the atlas work with their current methods."
          benefit: "However, there are several benefits to having seekers register directly on the Sahaj Atlas instead of other services."
        benefits:
          accessibility:

            title: "Accessibility"
            description: "While many people have Facebook and Meetup accounts, many do not. Increasingly younger people reject facebook, and Meetup is less popular amongst older people. Registering on Sahaj Atlas doesn't require any account and the seeker doesn't have to navigate to another website. This makes is easier and more likely for them to register."

            icon: bell # Do not translate
            title: "Automatic Reminders"
            description: "Seekers who register on Sahaj Atlas will receive a confirmation email and an automatic reminder email 1 day before their first class. The yogi(ni) who runs the public program will also receive a list of new registrations every week by email."

            title: "Future Marketing"
            description: "When seekers register on Sahaj Atlas we can store their email address (and we are not subject to the rules of Meetup, Eventbrite, or Facebook). This means we can use these email addresses to send follow-up materials, or recommend special Sahaj events in their area (eg. concerts or intermediate programs)."
